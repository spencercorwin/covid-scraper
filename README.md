# Useful Twitter Bots

This repository is for several Twitter bots.

## @dailygoldquotes

Tweets out gold and silver prices daily with relevant charts. Follow [@dailygoldquotes](https://twitter.com/dailygoldquotes) on Twitter to see it in action. It will now follow back everyone who is following it at the end of each week.

## Popularity Tracker

Every week the popularity tracker function will run, which will check how many Twitter followers every current and potential 2020 presidential candidate has. It will also check followers for several potential rising stars who are not necessarily 2020 candidates. It will then store the number of followers and the date into a database so that the data can be analyzed and put on a public website later. This should make it easy to analyze, and possibly predict, the rise of candidates in the 2020 race.
